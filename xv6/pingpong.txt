Hello this is the first occurence of ping.
You must have used ping command in Linux. 
A process could use the ping system call to check network connectivity.
In the xv6 operating system, system calls act as the bridge between user-level applications and the kernel.
A process could use a custom ping system call to send special messages between processes.
