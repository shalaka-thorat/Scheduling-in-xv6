## Overview
● Scheduling algorithms are essential in Operating Systems as they determine how CPU allocation to the processes, and in turn influence CPU utilization.<br>
 ● This project provides a practical aspect of exploring scheduling algorithms by implementing them in xv6.<br>
 ● This project aims to enhance the CPU scheduling mechanism in the xv6.
